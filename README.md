## Basic Mechanism
- You need to utilize your equipment in almost every fight.
- Some fight does not require equipment to win, that's when you can stack up some equipment for later fight.
- Bosses will drop powerful items, always save them for another boss fight.
- You can also click on the status bar to access your inventory.
- There is also bonfire system where you can recover your hp on the map.
- Some monster will drop the flint, that will light up all the faded bonfires again.
- The bonfire is important because it is one of a few ways to recover hp during the journey, some other ways include drinking monster's blood dropped by the monster, leveling up, or talking with specific NPC.
- Its a game where different themes are put together to bring the player different feelings in each theme.
- Each theme has different enemies, different map and different artworks, ui, etc.

## Story
- If you killed the monster on the node before triggering the plot, it will have different dialog.
- NPC dialog will get updated during the course of the game. For example, you have not talk to the NPC to trigger the mission, but you fulfill the mission objectives.

## Theme
- The first theme is more of a strategy game, that you need to utilize your resources to survive.
- The second theme will start after you finish the first, it will be a totally different theme but having similiar basic mechanism such as battle and dialog, but it will be different in terms of how the story is presented.
- The second theme has more dialog and less difficult battles, this is to allow the player to enjoy the story without worrying about being dead like they did in the first theme.
- Dying is normal, as it is a game about an endless dream.
